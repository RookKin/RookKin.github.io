# HikerTrack (for HikerTrash)

A place for those who thru hike and want to share their travels with others

Right now, this site will use your Garmin InReach KML feed to deliver your last pinged location so others can view your progress on the PCT. 

Below you can see future features I will be looking to add as this project progresses.

## TODOS:
- [ ] Find a way to trace the percentage of the trail that has been done
- [ ] Add login process so other users can get their own personal InReach feeds loaded in on log in
- [ ] Create a site structure that is more than just the KML map. Inspirations:
  - [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com)
  - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
- [ ] Awards/achievements system based on trail completions
- [ ] Possibly switch from Google Maps to Mapbox for more flexiblity
- [ ] Add additional trails so it looks a bit like longtrailsmap.net
- [ ] Allow users not thru-hiking to subscribe to other thru-hikers' maps so they can follow along
